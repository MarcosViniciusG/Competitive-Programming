1. What's the simplest solution possible?:
- Base case

2. Play around with examples and visualize

3. Relate hard cases to simpler cases
- Relationship between answers from function

4. Generalize the pattern
- Ex: sum(n) = sum(n-1) + n
- Build (solve smaller problems)

- Recursive Leap of Faith:
    Assume simpler cases work out

5. Implement the solution
